## Introduction

### Core Data

an object graph management and persistence framework in the OS X and iOS SDKs

* it is not a relational database
* it can SQQLite as the data store behind the scenes

#### Object Graph Management

Core Data works with objects that you define

* Cocoa : an object-oriented framework - storing data in objects
* Core Data builds on this to keep track of the objects and their relationships to each other

#### Persistence

the data is stored somewhere durable

* lazily loading objects
* caching to optimize both memory usage and speed

#### Many other Features

- custom filtering
- sort the data
- synchronize a data store with iCloud

## Your First Core Data App

* model data using Xcode's model editor
* add new records to Core Data
* fetch a set of records form Core Data
* display the fetched results in a table view

### Getting Started

#### Core Data Stack

* boilerplate code
* consists a set of objects that facilitate saving and retrieving information from CoreData
* can customize the stack to be more efficient

#### TalbeView's DataSource

* make the view controller the table view's data source
* ViewController - manually, TableViewController - autumatically

#### Set up the Model

* a mutable Array

#### registerClass

* register the class : ?
* it will reurn a correct type

#### UITableViewDataSource protocol

* the class conform to the protocol should implement the data source methods
* tableView(tableView: numberOfRowsInSection:) : how many rows
* tableView(tableView: cellForRowAtIndexPath:) : dequeues table view cells and pupulates them with the data

#### UIAlertViewController

* custom a UIAlertViewController

#### reloadData()

### Modeling your data

#### Persistence

* plain Swift Strings : store the data in memory
* Core Data : represents data on disk

- to create a **managed object model**
- by default, Core Data uses an SQLite database as the persistent store
- think of the data model as the database schema

> `Managed` : refers to Core Data's management of the life cycle of Core Data Objects - `NSManagedObjectContext`
> a comprehensive list of Core Data classes : **<CoreData/CoreData.h>**

* use Core Data : Xcode automatically created a data model file - *****.xcdatamodel**
	* a powerful data model editor : a lot of features

* Core Data terms : its own vocabulary
	* **entity** : a class definition in Core Data - a table (in a relational database)
	* **attribute** : a piece of information attached to a particular - a particular field in a table
	* **relationship** : a link between multiple entities
		* **to-one relationships** : between two entities
		* **to-many relationship** : between one and many entites

> the difference between entity and class
>
> a Core Data entity : as a class **definition**
>
> the managed object : as an instance of that class

### Saving to Core Data

#### Import the Core Data

* import the Core Data module : a simple `import` statement is all you need to start using Core Data APIs
* replace the table view's model : `NSManagedObject`
	* represents a single object stored in Core Data
	* a shape-shifter : can take the form of any entity in data model
* replace both data source methods

> KVC (key-value coding)
>
> 	* a mechanism in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch for accessing an objec's properties indirectly
> 	* available to all clsses that descend from `NSObject`, including `NSManagedObject`

#### Save or Retrieve anything from Core Data Store

* get on an `NSManagedObjectContext` : an in-memory *scratchpad* for working with managed objects
- saving a new managed object to Core Data : two-step process
	- insert a new managed object into a managed object context
	- `commit` the changes in managed object context to save it to disk
* Xcode : a managed object context as part of the new project's template - only if you check the **Use Core Data**
* default managed object context : as a property of the application delegate - to access it : get a reference to the app delegate

- create a new managed object and insert it into the managed object context : `NSManagedObject`'s designated initializer - `init(entity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext:)`
	- `NSEntityDescription` : the peice that links the entity definition from your data model with an instance of `NSManagedObject` at runtime

#### Migration Issues

* lightweight migration : [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8881453/the-model-used-to-open-the-store-is-incompatible-with-the-one-used-to-create-the), [RayWenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/114084/core-data-migrations-tutorial-lightweight-migrations)

### Fetching from Core Data

#### Fetch

* **fetch** : to get data from your persistent store and into the managed object context

#### Step by step

1. pull up the application delegate, and grab a reference to its managed object context  
2. `NSFetchRequest` : the class responsible for fetching - have several qualifiers that refine the set of results (ex) `NSEntityDescription`)
	* `init(entityName:)` : setting a fetch request's entity
3. `executeFetchRequest(:error:)` : returns an optional array of managed objects

### Rough Edges

* get the managed object context from the app delegate each time
* KVC to access the attributes rather than a more natural object-style

## NSManagedObject Subclasses

* subclassing NSManagedObject : a direct one-to-one mapping between entities and classes - work with objects and properties
	* all the data types available in Core Data entities
	* validating data to automatically check values

### Getting Started

* **SampleData.plist** : contains the information
* **Images.xcassets** : the application's asset catalog

### Modeling your data

* an attribute's data type
* **Binary Data** : the option of storing arbitrary blobs of binary data
	* app's performance : **Allows External Storage** - Core Data heuristically decides on a per-value basis

### Storing non-standard data types in Core Data

* to store an instance of `UIColor`
	* deconstruct the color into its individual components and save them as integers
	* serialize the `UIColor` instance to `NSData` and save it as binary data

* **Transformable** : save any data to Core Data using the transformable type - conforms to the `NSCoding` protocol
	* `NSCoding` > `NSSecureCoding` > `NSCoding`

* the `NSCoding` protocol : a simple way to archive and unarchive objects into data buffers

### Managed object subclasses

* key-value coding
	* everything directly on `NSManagedObject`
	* accessing of data using strings instead of strogly-typed classes
	* errors such as mistyping and misspelling
	* not Swift's type-checking and Xcode's auto-completion

* Xcode can automatically generate the subclass : **Editor\Create NSManagedObject Subclass...**

* Core Data persists an **object graph** to disk : NSNumber - `boolValue`, `doubleValue`, and `integerValue`
* **Use scalar properies for primitive data types** : to work directly with primitive data types

> **@NSManaged** attribute : the backing store and implementation will be privided at runtime instead of at compile time
>
> a property on a managed object : backed by the managed object  context - the source of the data is not known at compile time

#### two main benefits

* unleash the syntactic power of Swift properties
* to override existing methods or to add your own convenience methods

#### a small test

* **AppDelegate.swift** : `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

### Propagating a managed context

* import Core Data

```
import CoreData
```

* add the property

```
var managedContext: NSManagedObjectContext!
```

* how to propagate a managed context : an important aspect of Core Data programming

#### get a managed context

* **AppDelegate.swift** : `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`

```
    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

        if let viewController = self.window!.rootViewController as? ViewController {
            viewController.managedContext = self.managedObjectContext
        }

        return true
    }
```

* pass the managed context from class to class : via a property
	* previous chapter : a global variable
	* benefic : cleaner code - the context moves "down" the chain rather than each object accessing some global state

#### adding two methods

* `insertSampleData`
* `colorFromDict`

* a file name, not the file image
* transformable


#### access the data

* `viewDidLoad`

* fetch the `Bowties` from Core Data and populate the UI

* the segmented control
* predicates : flexible and powerful


> `view.tintColor` : 화면에 일괄적으로 색을 입힐 수 있다.  
> view의 tintColor를 바꿈으로써 하위 UI의 색을 일괄적으로 바꿀 수 있다.  

#### add actions

* wear action
* rate action

### Data validation in Core Data

* Core Data supports validation for most attribute types out of the box

* **Attribute > Validation** : 0 for minimum, 5 for maximum

> Attribute validation don't need to versioning

* validation
	* immediately after you call `save` 	
	* the managed object context checks the new values conflict with the validation rules
	* if there's an error, the save fails
	* if the save fails, Core Data populates the NSError

#### present the alert view again

* if there's an error, then you present the alert view again

* `CoreDataErrors.h` : `NSValidationNumberTooLargeError`


```
    func updateRating(numericString: String) {
        let rating = Double(numericString)
        currentBowtie.rating = NSNumber(double: rating!)

        do {
            try managedContext.save()
            populate(currentBowtie)

        } catch(let error as NSError?) {
            if error!.code == NSValidationNumberTooLargeError ||
               error!.code == NSValidationNumberTooSmallError {
                rate(currentBowtie)
            }
        }
    }
```

### Tying everything up
