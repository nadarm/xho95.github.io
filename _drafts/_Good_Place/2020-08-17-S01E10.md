You know what?
It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk,
but you're barely even a regular, functioning person.
How did you get here?

You have some nerve asking me for favors
when you have spent weeks deceiving me,
making a fool out of me,
and bringing snack food into my house.
Disgusting!

Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now.

Shawn, the judge, could show up at any moment,
so we need to have a rock solid argument
for why Fake Eleanor should not
be sent to The Bad Place.

Should be fun.

That's the spirit!
Don't even think about the fact
that our slightest misstep
could cause Fake Eleanor
to suffer for eternity.

That's all I'm thinking about now.

Yep, shouldn't have said that.
Regretted it immediately.
Bambadjan was a human rights advocate,
so he and Real Eleanor will
build a sort of legal argument.
