Eleanor? come on in.

Hi, Eleanor. I'm Michael.
How are you today?

I'm great. Thanks for asking.
Oh, one question.
Where am I? Who are you,
and what's going on?

Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Your life on Earth has ended,
and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.

Cool. Cool. I have some questions.
Thought you might.

How did I die? I don't remember.

Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths,
we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition.

Are you sure you want to hear?

All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot.
You dropped a bottle of something callled,
"Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One."
And when you bent down to pick it up,
a long column of shopping carts
that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area
rolled out of control and plowed right into you.

Oof. That's how I died?

No, sorry, there's more.

You were able to grab on the front of the column of shopping carts,
but it'd swept you right out into the street
where you were struck and killed
by a mobile billboard truck advertising
an erectile dysfunction pill called
"Engorge-ulate"
