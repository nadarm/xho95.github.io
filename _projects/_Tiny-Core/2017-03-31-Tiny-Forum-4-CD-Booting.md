Thank you everybody.

As your suggestion, I made a Tiny Core bootable CD and booted with it.

If I do all the work on this Tiny Core linux, everything is going to well. OK?

And is it right that I have to work here to develop my program to create a tcz file?

Anyway I'm going to try a few things. 

Thank you.
